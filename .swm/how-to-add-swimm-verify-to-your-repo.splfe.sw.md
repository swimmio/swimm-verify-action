## Before we start, just letting you know...

**If you prefer, this is how to use the GitHub Swimm Verify workflow**

# Swimm Verify GitHub Action

Verify Swimm units as part of your workflow.

## Usage

Running verification on your repo could be done by using [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/quickstart), by adding a simple workflow to your repo.

Follow the example below to verify your Swimm units on Pull-Requests:

In your repository, create a new file named `📄 .github/workflows/swimm_verify.yml`. This file describes the workflow steps that will run on your pull request.

(If you are not familiar with the syntax, head over to [this link](https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/1214409/Learn-YAML-in-five-minutes) to learn more)

<br/>

In your new workflow file, write down this content.

If you prefer, you can control **when** will this check run, by replacing the `on`[<sup id="ZRrjML">↓</sup>](#f-ZRrjML) definition.

You can also control the **operating system** that the workflow will run over by replacing `ubuntu-latest`[<sup id="1mShB5">↓</sup>](#f-1mShB5) with another OS.

Once added to your repository, it should look like that on pull requests (when all of your documents are verified 😉)
