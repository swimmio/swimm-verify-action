## Before we start, just letting you know...

### Swimm is on GitHub Marketplace! üéâ

We built a smart botü§ñ that helps keeping your internal documentation up to date!

**If you prefer, this is how to use the GitHub Swimm Verify workflow**

# Swimm Verify GitHub Action

Verify Swimm units as part of your workflow.

## Usage

Running verification on your repo could be done by using [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/quickstart), by adding a simple workflow to your repo.

Follow the example below to verify your Swimm units on Pull-Requests:

In your repository, create a new file named <SwmPath>[.github/workflows/swimm_verify.yml](/.github/workflows/swimm_verify.yml)</SwmPath>. This file describes the workflow steps that will run on your pull request.

(If you are not familiar with the syntax, head over to [this link](https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/1214409/Learn-YAML-in-five-minutes) to learn more)

<SwmSnippet path="/.github/workflows/swimm_verify.yml" line="1">

---

In your new workflow file, write down this content.

If you prefer, you can control **when** will this check run, by replacing the <SwmToken path="/.github/workflows/swimm_verify.yml" pos="3:0:0" line-data="on: pull_request">`on`</SwmToken> definition.

You can also control the **operating system** that the workflow will run over by replacing <SwmToken path="/.github/workflows/swimm_verify.yml" pos="7:6:8" line-data="    runs-on: ubuntu-latest">`ubuntu-latest`</SwmToken> with another OS.

```yaml
name: Swimm Verify

on: pull_request

jobs:
  Verify:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0
          ref: ${{ github.head_ref }}
      - uses: swimmio/swimm-verify-action@v1.3
```

Once added to your repository, it should look like that on pull requests (when all of your documents are verified üòâ)
